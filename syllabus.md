# CSE 30: Intro to Computer Systems
## Course Syllabus
Welcome to CSE 30: Intro to Computer Systems! We are so excited to have you in this course! :)


## Basic Information
Instructor: Gerald “Jerry” Soosairaj (https://geraldsoosairaj.github.io/)
Course Website:


## Course Overview
CSE 30 introduces you to an exciting range of materials from the broad field of systems programming, including 1) the basics of how a single program executes on a computer, 2) higher-level programming in C, and 3) assembly-language programming. All very cool stuff that every programmer should know!

### Prerequisites
This course assumes familiarity with basic programming (CS 8A, 8B, 11), basic data structures (CSE 12), and some software tools and techniques like working with Unix commands at the terminal (CSE 15L). You'll be doing a lot of hands-on assignments in both C (the greatest language ever, naturally), and assembly (x86).

### Learning Objectives
Students who successfully complete this course will be able to:
1. Describe how a single C program runs on a computer
2. Read, write, debug, and test C programs
3. Read and understand Assembly programs in x86
4. Use effective programming practices like incremental development, debugging/testing
5. Use tools to work with C and Assembly programs (e.g., GDB - GNU Debugger)

### How exactly are we going to learn these cool things?
We will learn these things by doing the following activities in a loop for 10 weeks.
1. **Readings:** Complete reading assignments before every class (except lecture 1)
2. **Lectures:** Attend and participate in lectures where we will learn these concepts
3. **Discussions:** Attend and participate in discussions to learn practical skills and tools
4. **Programming Assignments:** Complete programming assignments that will help you to develop your code writing skills
5. **Worksheets:** Complete worksheets that will help you with conceptual understanding
6. **Office/Tutor Hours:** Interacting with course staff during office/tutor hours


## How will we assess your learning?
We will **assess** your learning using the following components:
### 1. Reading Quizzes
There will be one reading quiz every week which will test if you have read and understood the reading assignments assigned for every lecture. Reading quizzes will be conducted on Edstem (online IDE for CSE 30). Reading quizzes will be released on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 3pm. Reading quizzes for every lecture will be **due at 9am on the day of the lecture**. Readings will be assigned from *free online textbooks*!

### 2. Lecture Participation
